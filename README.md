# **OptiMUS**: Optimization Modeling Using mip Solvers and large language models


This repository contains the official implementation for the following three papers (you can use branches to access the other versions):


[OptiMUS: Optimization Modeling Using mip Solvers and large language models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06116).

[OptiMUS: Scalable Optimization Modeling with (MI) LP Solvers and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10172).

[OptiMUS-0.3: Using Large Language Models to Model and Solve Optimization Problems at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19633)
