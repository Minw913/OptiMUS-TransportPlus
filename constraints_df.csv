206,"""The goal is to minimize the total usage of curry base""","let's think through the problem step by step.

The objective is to minimize the total usage of the curry base.

We have two types of curry bowls:
1. Goat curry bowls, with each bowl using `CurryBasePerGoatCurry` units of curry base.
2. Chicken curry bowls, with each bowl using `CurryBasePerChickenCurry` units of curry base.

The variables are:
- `goatCurryBowls`: the number of goat curry bowls made.
- `chickenCurryBowls`: the number of chicken curry bowls made.

To minimize the total usage of curry base, we need to minimize the sum of the curry base used for both goat curry bowls and chicken curry bowls.

The total curry base used for goat curry bowls is:
\[ \text{CurryBasePerGoatCurry} \times \text{goatCurryBowls} \]

The total curry base used for chicken curry bowls is:
\[ \text{CurryBasePerChickenCurry} \times \text{chickenCurryBowls} \]

Therefore, the objective function to minimize is:
\[ \text{CurryBasePerGoatCurry} \times \text{goatCurryBowls} + \text{CurryBasePerChickenCurry} \times \text{chickenCurryBowls} \]

209,"""The goal is to minimize the total usage of curry base""","let's think through the problem step by step.

The objective is to minimize the total usage of the curry base.

We have two types of curry bowls:
1. Goat curry bowls, with each bowl using `CurryBasePerGoatCurry` units of curry base.
2. Chicken curry bowls, with each bowl using `CurryBasePerChickenCurry` units of curry base.

The variables are:
- `goatCurryBowls`: the number of goat curry bowls made.
- `chickenCurryBowls`: the number of chicken curry bowls made.

To minimize the total usage of curry base, we need to minimize the sum of the curry base used for both goat curry bowls and chicken curry bowls.

The total curry base used for goat curry bowls is:
\[ \text{CurryBasePerGoatCurry} \times \text{goatCurryBowls} \]

The total curry base used for chicken curry bowls is:
\[ \text{CurryBasePerChickenCurry} \times \text{chickenCurryBowls} \]

Therefore, the objective function to minimize is:
\[ \text{CurryBasePerGoatCurry} \times \text{goatCurryBowls} + \text{CurryBasePerChickenCurry} \times \text{chickenCurryBowls} \]

Now, let's put this in LaTeX format.
