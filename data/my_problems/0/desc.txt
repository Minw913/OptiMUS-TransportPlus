An e-commerce firm must send identical electric vans from its depot to three cities: A (120 km, 8 000 parcels), B (150 km, 10 000 parcels) and C (175 km, 6 000 parcels). Each van holds 400 parcels and can travel 200 km before needing a 40-minute fast charge that restores 140 km of range; two highway stations each have only two chargers available at any moment. Every driver’s shift is limited to 480 minutes, covering driving (assume 60 km/h), charging and loading time. The firm wants to meet every city’s daily demand while respecting battery range, charger capacity and shift length, and it seeks to minimise the fleet’s total distance driven. How many vans, routes and charging stops should be planned to achieve this minimum?
