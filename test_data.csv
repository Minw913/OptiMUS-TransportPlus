'''
A glass factory produces Regular and Tempered glass panes. Producing one Regular
pane requires HeatingRegular time on the heating machine and CoolingRegular time
on the cooling machine. Producing one Tempered pane requires HeatingTempered
time on the heating machine and CoolingTempered time on the cooling machine. The
heating machine is available for a maximum of MaxHeatingTime per day, and the
cooling machine is available for a maximum of MaxCoolingTime per day. Each
Regular pane generates a profit of ProfitRegular, and each Tempered pane
generates a profit of ProfitTempered. The factory aims to determine the number
of Regular and Tempered panes to produce in order to maximize total profit.

A water company sells glass and plastic bottles. Each glass bottle can hold
GlassBottleCapacity milliliters of water while each plastic bottle can hold
PlasticBottleCapacity milliliters of water. The number of plastic bottles must
be at least MinPlasticRatio times the number of glass bottles. There must be at
least MinGlassBottles glass bottles. The company has TotalWater milliliters of

A patient receives radiation treatment using Beam1 and Beam2. Beam1 delivers
DoseRateBeam1BenignPancreas units per minute to the benign area of the pancreas,
DoseRateBeam1BenignSkin units per minute to the benign area of the skin, and
DoseRateBeam1Tumor units per minute to the tumor. Similarly, Beam2 delivers
DoseRateBeam2BenignPancreas units per minute to the benign area of the pancreas,

A researcher needs to perform two types of experiments: in-vivo and ex-vivo.
Each in-vivo experiment requires PrepTimeInVivo for preparation and
ExecTimeInVivo for execution, and yields RadiationInVivo radiation. Each ex-vivo
experiment requires PrepTimeExVivo for preparation and ExecTimeExVivo for
